The goal of the package is to provide a function to automatically import
the Brazilian COVID-19 pandemic data into R. Brazilian data is available
on country, region, state, and city levels, and are downloaded from the
official Brazilian repository at \<<https://covid.saude.gov.br/>\>. The
package also enables one to download the world-level COVID-19 data from
the Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s repository at
\<<https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>\>.
