The Brazilian COVID-19 data, obtained from the official Brazilian repository at <https://covid.saude.gov.br/>, is available at the country, region, state, and city levels. The package also downloads world-level COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University's repository. COVID-19 data is available from the start of follow-up until to May 5, 2023, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an end to the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for COVID-19.
