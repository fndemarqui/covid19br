<p>This vignette shows how to use the R package <strong>covid19br</strong> for downloading and exploring data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and the globe as well. The package downloads data bases from the following repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The official brazilian repository provided by the brazilian government: <a href="https://covid.saude.gov.br">https://covid.saude.gov.br</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>The Johns Hopkins University’s repository: <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last repository has data on the COVID-19 pandemic in the global level (daily counts of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered patients by countries and territories), and has been widely used all over the world as a reliable source of data information on the COVID-19 pandemic. The former repository, on the other hand, possesses data on the Brazilian territory by city, state, region and national levels.</p>
<p>We hope that this package may be helpful to other researchers and scientists to understand and fight this terrible epidemic that has been plaguing the world.</p>
