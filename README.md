The goal of the package is to provide a function to automatically import
the Brazilian COVID-19 pandemic data into R. Brazilian data is available
on country, region, state, and city levels, and are downloaded from the
official Brazilian repository at \<<https://covid.saude.gov.br/>\>. The
package also enables one to download the world-level COVID-19 data from
the Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s repository at
\<<https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>\>.

## Installation

You can install the released version of covid19br from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("covid19br")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fndemarqui/covid19br")
```

## Example
